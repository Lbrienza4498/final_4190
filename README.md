Final Project for COMM 4190 

PR for any transportation services (i.e., Amtrak, NJ Transit, MTA..xyz)

There are currently no efficient ways of communicating delays to users and these train stations get flooded with people
Avoid dissatisfaction with transportation services
AI can send the message to riders a lot quicker than word-of-mouth communication
Amtrak app never communicates delays, people use railrat.net

Amtrak disseminating information: if one person knows, maybe not everyone knows
Unsafe situations with the subway- need a communication system for this so people know they are in risky situations
Emergency: this is what happened AND maybe this is how to get to your route (alternative routes, optimizing distance when for example subway isnt available and you have to take the bus)

If a rider sees someone gets pushed on the train tracks, they alert the transportation service and the higher-up person notifies the rest of riders

Feed it the internet results, would formulate what he search uinput would be 
This is how you get from A to B when you cant takew the train 


Whoever is knowledgeable, 
The train is down, i need to get from manhattan to the airport (LGA, JFK), look up on google: my train is canceled….
This is where your block is and then take this route

Try google maps (google maps) , take no highways, take the train, go from point A to B but with stipulations
OR 
Crowd-sourced info

General Blast is what well focus on first: AI-driven so it is quick and gets to all riders, on the screen when you’re at the station, when you’re on the app, on social media

ChatBot: if you’re feeling very worried or need the alternate route
